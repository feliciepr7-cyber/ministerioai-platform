Technical Support Ticket System

1. System Overview

A web-based application that allows users to submit, track, and manage technical support requests. Support agents can efficiently process, prioritize, and resolve these tickets, ensuring clear communication and timely solutions.

2. Core User Roles

1. End User / Submitter: Can create new tickets, view their own tickets, add comments, and close tickets if their issue is resolved.
2. Support Agent / Technician: Can view assigned tickets, update ticket status, add internal notes (visible only to agents), assign tickets to themselves or others, and resolve tickets.
3. Admin / Manager: Has full system access. Can manage users (create agents, assign roles), view all tickets and analytics, manage categories/priorities, and configure system settings.

3. Core Features & Functionality

For End Users:

· Submit a Ticket: Intuitive form with fields for subject, description, category, and priority.
· User Portal/Dashboard: View a list of their submitted tickets with statuses (Open, In Progress, etc.).
· Ticket Details Page: View all updates, add public comments, and upload relevant files/screenshots.
· Email Notifications: Receive emails for key events (ticket created, agent reply, ticket resolved).

For Support Agents & Admins:

· Agent Dashboard: Overview of all tickets, filtered by status, priority, or assignee. Key metrics like open ticket count.
· Ticket Management:
  · Filtering & Sorting: Filter by status, priority, category, assignee, date, etc.
  · Assignment: Assign tickets to themselves or other agents.
  · Status Updates: Change status (e.g., Open -> In Progress -> Resolved).
  · Internal Notes: Add private comments visible only to the support team.
  · Priority Escalation: Change the priority of a ticket.
· Knowledge Base (Optional but recommended): Agents can link to or create knowledge base articles from resolved tickets to defuture future requests.
· Reporting (Admin): Generate reports on ticket volume, average resolution time, agent performance, common issues.

4. Data Model (Simplified Database Schema)

Here are the essential database tables:

· `Users`
  · user_id (PK), email, password_hash, name, role (User, Agent, Admin), created_at
· `Tickets` (The main table)
  · ticket_id (PK, e.g., TKT-1001), title, description, status (Open, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved, Closed), priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical), created_at, updated_at
  · submitter_id (FK to Users) - Who created the ticket.
  · assignee_id (FK to Users, nullable) - Which agent is assigned.
  · category_id (FK to Categories) - e.g., "Hardware", "Software", "Network".
· `Categories`
  · category_id (PK), name (e.g., "Login Issue", "Email Problem", "Printer Not Working")
· `Comments`
  · comment_id (PK), ticket_id (FK to Tickets), author_id (FK to Users), content, is_internal (Boolean - if True, only visible to agents), created_at
· `Attachments`
  · attachment_id (PK), ticket_id (FK to Tickets), comment_id (FK to Comments, nullable), file_name, file_path, uploaded_at

5. Workflow & User Interface (UI) Flow

1. Submission: User Login -> Dashboard -> "Create New Ticket" -> Fill Form -> Submit Form includes: Title, Description (WYSIWYG editor helpful), Category dropdown, Priority dropdown, File attachment button.

2. Processing:

1. Ticket is created with status "Open" and appears in the agent queue.
2. An agent assigns the ticket to themselves, changing status to "In Progress".
3. The agent investigates, adds internal notes if needed, and may request more info from the user via a public comment.
4. Once a solution is found, the agent changes the status to "Resolved" and adds a summary comment.

3. Resolution:

1. The user is notified that their ticket is resolved.
2. The user can verify the fix.
3. If happy, the user can close the ticket (status: "Closed"). If not, they can reply, reopening it (status -> "Open").

6. Technology Stack Suggestions

· Backend (API): Node.js (Express), Python (Django, Flask), PHP (Laravel), Java (Spring Boot).
· Frontend: React.js, Vue.js, Angular, or even server-rendered pages with Django/Laravel templates.
· Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
· Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based.
· File Storage: Local storage or cloud storage like AWS S3.
· Real-time Updates (Optional): Socket.io for live notifications on ticket updates.
· Email Service: SMTP, or third-party APIs like SendGrid, Mailgun.

7. Basic Implementation Outline (Pseudocode)

1. Create a Ticket Endpoint (`POST /api/tickets`)

```javascript
// 1. Validate user input (title, description)
// 2. Authenticate user (get user_id from session/JWT)
// 3. Create ticket in database:
const newTicket = await db.query(`
    INSERT INTO tickets (ticket_id, title, description, status, priority, submitter_id, category_id)
    VALUES (CONCAT('TKT-', nextval('ticket_seq')), $1, $2, 'Open', $3, $4, $5)
    RETURNING *`,
    [title, description, priority, user_id, category_id]
);
// 4. Send confirmation email to user
// 5. Return success response with new ticket data
```

2. Agent Dashboard Query (GET /api/tickets)

```sql
SELECT
    t.ticket_id,
    t.title,
    t.status,
    t.priority,
    t.created_at,
    u.name as submitter_name,
    cat.name as category_name,
    agent.name as assignee_name
FROM tickets t
JOIN users u ON t.submitter_id = u.user_id
JOIN categories cat ON t.category_id = cat.category_id
LEFT JOIN users agent ON t.assignee_id = agent.user_id
WHERE t.status != 'Closed'
ORDER BY t.priority DESC, t.created_at ASC;
```

3. Adding a Comment (`POST /api/tickets/:id/comment`)

```javascript
// 1. Check if user has permission to comment on this ticket
// 2. Check `is_internal` flag: if true, only agents/admins can see it.
// 3. Insert comment into `comments` table, linking to ticket_id and author_id.
// 4. If it's a public comment, send an email notification to the original submitter.
// 5. Update the `updated_at` field of the ticket.
```

8. Security Considerations

· Authentication & Authorization: Ensure users can only see their own tickets, and agents can only see assigned or all tickets based on role.
· Input Validation/Sanitization: Prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing user input in comments and descriptions.
· File Upload Security: Scan uploaded files for malware. Restrict file types (e.g., no .exe). Store them outside the web root.
· Rate Limiting: Prevent spam on ticket submission and comment endpoints.
· SQL Injection: Use parameterized queries (never concatenate user input into SQL strings).

This design provides a solid foundation for a functional and scalable technical support ticket system. You can start with a minimal viable product (MVP) containing just the core features and gradually add more advanced ones like the knowledge base, real-time chat, or SLA management.
